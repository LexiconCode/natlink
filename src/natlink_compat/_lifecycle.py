"""_lifecycle.py - Connection lifecycle: natConnect, natDisconnect, waitForSpeech.

Natlink is a "global client" — not tied to a specific application window.
"This implementation is designed to be a global client and not a app-specific
client.  That decision simplifies the design somewhat."
— Joel Gould, appsupp.cpp

As a global client, Dragon calls Register once at startup and UnRegister once
at shutdown.  AddProcess/EndProcess (per-app lifecycle) are no-ops.
