Install instructions for Natlink
===================================

- Install Dragon NaturallySpeaking
- Install Python (32 bit required) for your user and do not add to path. (this may be done automatically by the inno setup installer.)
- Download and run the latest [Natlink installer](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/natlink/releases): choose the most recent release, at the top of the page, and then scroll down and choose the file natlink?.?.?-py3.8-32-setup.exe.
- Pip install your desired extra packages (e.g. `pip install dragonfly`, `pip install unimacro vocola2 dtactions`). Do this in a 'Windows Powershell' or 'Command prompt', which you need to 'Run as administrator'.
- When you start Dragon, the Messages from Natlink window should show up, with the "fallback" informations.
