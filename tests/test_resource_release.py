"""test_resource_release.py - What Dragon actually releases, measured.

Per-loader teardown depends on being able to release one loader's objects
without disturbing another's. Whether that is possible is a property of
Dragon, not of our code, so it was determined empirically and is pinned here.

The instrument is ``comtypes.COMObject._refcnt`` on each sink, which counts
Dragon's cross-process references. Our own Python attribute is not an AddRef
and does not contribute, so 0 means Dragon has let go entirely.

Measured on Dragon 13 (2026-08-02):

  grammar sink    5 refs after load/activate  -> 0 after unload()
  dictation sink  7 refs after activate       -> 7 after deactivate()
                                              -> 0 after destroy()

The dictation asymmetry is the trap: ``deactivate()`` releases nothing, so a
loader that deactivates without destroying leaks every reference.

Notably there is no explicit per-grammar UnRegister in the API — releasing
our interface pointers is what makes Dragon let go.
