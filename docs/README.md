# Natlink

Natlink is a compatibility module for [Dragon NaturallySpeaking (DNS/DPI)](https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html) v13-v16 on Windows that allows the user to run Python scripts that interact with DNS on Windows OS.

## Introduction <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Natlink can be used as a library for low-level access Dragon engine, or as a framework for writing grammars and macros.

Grammars can be used to insert text boilerplate, operate the menus of programs, or otherwise control a computer. They can even be used to help
write computer programs. A grammar specifies what will happen when certain words are dictated with grammar rules. For example, a hypothetical grammar could have a very simple rule `american date today` which prints the current date out in a format `mm/dd/yyyy`.
