Installation
============

Note this install version is the same as can be cloned via github for several months. A more mature version is nearby (July, 2021).


Natlink (for python 3) can be installed via pip (pypi), when Dragon is NOT running.

Start a :code:`Cmd` shell in elevated mode.

.. code:: shell

   $ pip install natlink
   $ natlinkconfig
   
The configure program will pop up. Choose :code:`(re)Register Natlink` and :code:`Close`.

Then restart :code:`Dragon`
