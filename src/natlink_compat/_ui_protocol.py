"""UI protocol for natlink.

Third parties implement UIProvider to own natlink's UI surface.
Natlink pushes state changes and text output; the provider decides
how to display them.  To issue commands back, ``import natlink_compat``
and call its module-level functions (e.g. ``natlink_compat.restart_dragon()``).

UIProvider contract::

    def on_state_changed(self, state: NatlinkState) -> None: ...
    def on_text(self, text: str, level: int = 20) -> None: ...
    def stop(self) -> None: ...

Exactly one provider is active at a time. Third parties replace the
default provider by registering their own implementation.
